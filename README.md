# Telco-Customer-Retention-AB-Testing
I solved the "Predictive Churn Paradox" using Causal AI and Uplift Modeling on 100k Telco records. By analyzing a 20% discount A/B test via an S-Learner, I identified "Persuadable" segments to unlock $1.22M in annual revenue. This moves churn from simple prediction to a high-ROI prescriptive strategy for stakeholders.
